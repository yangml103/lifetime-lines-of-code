# lifetime-lines-of-code README
This is the README for the extension "lifetime-lines-of-code". This extension allows you to count the lines of code in a specific folder. You can select the folder using a popup folder browser, and the language using a dropdown menu. 

## Overview

This is a response to job applications/school applications that ask for an estimate of how many lines of code you've written in your lifetime. What a dumb question. This won't give you an exact number, but it will give you a rough estimate, which is better than nothing. 

## Features

* Count lines of code in a specific folder: The extension will count the lines of code in the selected folder*, and the total lines will be printed onto the console.

* The extension will only count Python, Java, Js, Ts, HTML, CSS, C++, C#, C, and SQL. More languages could be added in the future if necessary. Let me know if you need other languages

## How to Use

1. Run the command 'Count Lines' in the command palette by pressing control + shift + p. A dialog will open for you to select a folder.
2. Select a folder. 
3. Select the languages.
4. The extension will start counting the lines of code in the selected folder.
5. The total lines of code will be printed in a vscode notification box on the bottom right corner.
